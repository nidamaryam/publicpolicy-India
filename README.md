# publicpolicy-India
Using multiple economic and social indicators collected for each state, 
applying PCA dimensionality reduction and using K-Means Clustering to partition the states into groups with similar development levels. 
These clusters serve as basis for planning public policy by helping allocate resources to develop 
infrastructure, education, and welfare programs based on these development levels.

The final aim is to select states with diversity to pilot policy projects in India and understand effects for further implementation.
